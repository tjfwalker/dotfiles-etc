By default, mkdocs figures the documentation directory is `docs/`[^1] â€”at the
project root co-located with `mkdocs.yml`; so, I'm renaming `README/` to `docs/`
and creating `README.md` at the root that will explain how to view the docs by
spinning up the mkdocs dev server. Doing this will enable many tools used with
Git repos to render the README on the repo 'homepages'.
